	<h1>Minecraft builds and how they have changed overtime</h1>


	<p>Minecraft is a game that first had its initial release back in 2009. Creating your home is an essential part of the game in order for you to survive. Some people simply build a box and call it home while others create stylized buildings. Over the 16 years that Minecraft has been around there has been many evolutions and trends that have come. Whether it was a new block added to the game or a new building technique pioneered by an individual, Minecraft has become its own art medium as time has progressed. Through this series of websites I intend to show you the evolutions of the game through a visual history.</p>
